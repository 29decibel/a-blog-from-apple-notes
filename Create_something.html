<div>Creating something at the beginning always feels exciting. There are so many things we can do; it’s an open space, with endless possibilities.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Then we bumped into one issue; it’s a dead end. We got deflated. We dropped the idea, going back to the comfortable zone.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>After many tries and many give-ups, I realized that it’s not the smooth progress in creating things that matters; it’s the setbacks, the frustrations, and the impossibility of solving hard problems that matter.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>These things keep our brains busy; they build our resilience; they build our character.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Next time when you want to create something, be prepared to embrace the struggles, the hard problems; they are your friends in creating something truly meaningful.</div>
